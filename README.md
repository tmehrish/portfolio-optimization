This github repository serves as an account for all my past, and possible present, work with Quantum Data Technologies. More specifically, this repo includes a myriad of advanced statistical models that I created to look at the 11 S&P sectors' performance. The goal of this project was to build an efficient portfolio optimization model that was incorporated into an interactive dashboard using Dash for Plotly, a Python graphing library.
